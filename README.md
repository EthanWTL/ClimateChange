# Understand Climate Types using Unsupervised Machine Learning
# Introduction:

Hi, Scientists and Geologists. :smiley:

We are working on understanding different climate types in North American Continent. 

This research has a focus on using unsupervised learning like **Kmean** and **Self Organizing Maps** to clustering different climate types.<br>

# Background:
We received 10 years of [Pressure](Pressure_rawdata) and Wind data for North American Continent in csv format.
